# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I graduated from Concordia University's Software Engineering program and recently joined Jarvis as a software and data engineer developing projects using Java 1.8, Maven, Python, Linux/Bash, Git, Docker, and RDBMS. During my Master's program, I spent two years developing multiple projects with Matlab, Python, and C# in different teams of developers. I am fluent in French. I love programming and computer science because it is a language that can apply to every facet of life. My experiences have taught me how to think outside of the box when developing software, and I always strive to find the most optimized solution to the problem.

    description: Developed a Linux monitoring agent that allows a user to monitor and store hardware specifications and usage information for multiple Linux systems. The agent employs Bash Scripts to collect machine hardware information, which is then stored in a PostgreSQL database provisioned using Docker. The resource usage is fetched periodically with Crontab, and we can then manipulate the aggregated data using SQL queries.
