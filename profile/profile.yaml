# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a graduate of Concordia University's software engineering program, and I have recently joined Jarvis as a software and data engineer. During Master's program, I spent two years to develop multiple projects with Matlab, Python and C# in different teams of developers. I am fluent in French language. I love programming and computer science because it is a language that can apply to every facet of life. Software provides significant benefits to everything in our lives, and it's critical to have a deep knowledge of it.

    description: Developed a Linux monitoring agent that allows a user to monitor and store hardware specifications and usage information for multiple Linux systems. The agent employs Bash Scripts to collect machine hardware information, which is then stored in a PostgreSQL database provisioned using Docker. The resource usage is fetched periodically with Crontab, and we can then manipulate the aggregated data using SQL queries.
