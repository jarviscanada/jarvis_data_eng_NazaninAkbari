# Nazanin Akbari . Jarvis Consulting

I graduated from Concordia University's Software Engineering program and recently joined Jarvis as a software and data engineer developing projects using Java 1.8, Maven, Python, Linux/Bash, Git, Docker, and RDBMS. During my Master's program, I spent two years developing multiple projects with Matlab, Python, and C# in different teams of developers. I am fluent in French. I love programming and computer science because it is a language that can apply to every facet of life. My experiences have taught me how to think outside of the box when developing software, and I always strive to find the most optimized solution to the problem.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NazaninAkbari](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NazaninAkbari)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NazaninAkbari/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NazaninAkbari/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux monitoring agent that allows a user to monitor and store hardware specifications and usage information for multiple Linux systems. The agent employs Bash Scripts to collect machine hardware information, which is then stored in a PostgreSQL database provisioned using Docker. The resource usage is fetched periodically with Crontab, and we can then manipulate the aggregated data using SQL queries.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NazaninAkbari/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NazaninAkbari/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  -  Twitter App: Currently working on the project.
  -  JDBC App: Implemented basic CRUD operations. This application is a demonstration of the DAO and Repository Design patterns being implemented using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).
  - Grep App: Implemented Java Grep application which allows users to search text patterns from a Linux filesystem using core Java, Lambda expression, Maven, IntelliJ, Regex. Application is dockerized in container and pushed to Docker Hub.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NazaninAkbari/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NazaninAkbari/tree/master/python_data_analytics)]: Performed data analysis for transaction data reported from LGS to help the marketing team to answer the business questions in order to increase the company's revenue using RFM report. The analysis were conducted using a Jupyter notebook, and Python was used along with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numPy and SQLAlchemy. Docker was used to run the Postgres container.


## Highlighted Projects
**Airline reservation system** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Na-zi/Projects/tree/main/airline-reservation)]: Designed an Airline Reservation System application that enables customers to search and book the flights using C#.NET, Microsoft Azure SQL, Visual Studio, etc. Tested the system with unit tests and integration tests. Git and Github were used as the version control system. Organized Scrum processes and activities through Microsoft Azure DevOps. Flow diagrams and context diagrams are used to model different sprints.

**Snake game** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Na-zi/Projects/tree/main/snake_game)]: Designed snake game using Python as Object-Oriented Language. The snake game has a snake that you can control by using your keyboard to grab the food. The game was developed in PyCharm.
